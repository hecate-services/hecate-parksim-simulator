%%% @doc Vehicle (robotaxi) aggregate state record.
%%%
%%% Owned by vehicle_state. Used by vehicle_aggregate and the slice
%%% handlers (`maybe_*`) for state-dependent validation.
%%%
%%% Position fields hold the vehicle's location AT THE LAST MILESTONE
%%% EVENT only — high-frequency movement is telemetry (in-memory in the
%%% fleet sim, streamed as a mesh fact), never event-sourced. battery_pct
%%% is likewise the value recorded at the last event, not live.
